    <p><em>These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've ever had Japanese tempura-coated veggies. 
        These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce,
         mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

                     and garam masala. Make a well in the center; gradually pour water into the well and mix to form a thick, smooth batter.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                <p>While the oil is heating, dip cauliflower florets and onion rings in batter to coat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
